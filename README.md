# recruitment

recruitment is the process of hiring candidates or employees in the need of a vacancy in a company. 

recruitment can be done in two ways online recruitment which is the modern way and offline recruitment which is the traditional method.

here the data is on-campus placement. 

300 students are completing their MBA degrees and they are going through a recruitment process for the assistant manager post. the data has many variables such as their basic qualifications and their age, sex, high school marks, and their board, their intermediate marks and their board, graduation, post-graduation, and if someone has experienced it will also add up.

we are predicting here how in the present scenario, the recruitment process has changed from the previous manner. we are showing how the online recruitment process is more favorable than the offline recruitment process and for the post of the assistant manager what variables have higher chances than the others.

we are using the logistic regression model for prediction.

logistic regression model is used when there are categorical variables and it is more favorable when we talk about the two categorical variables. for example - yes or no, in this case, hired or not hired in the recruitment process, or the person having a disease or not.
