# recruitment

recruitment is the preocess of hiring candidates or employees in the need of vacancy in a company. 

recruitment can be done through two ways online recruitment which is the modern way and the offline recruitment which is the traditional method.

here the data is of campus placement. the students are completing the MBA's degree and they are going for a recruitment process for assistant manager post. the data has many variables such as their basic qualifications and their age, sex, high school marks and their board, their intermedicate marks and their board , graducation , post-graduation and if someone has an experience it will also adds up.

we are predicting here how in the present sceanario, recruitment process has changed from the previous manner. we are showing how online recruitment process is more favorable than offline recruitment process and for the post of assistant manager what variables have higher chances than the others.

we are using the logistic regression model for prediction.

logistic regression model is used when there is categorical variables and it is more favorable when we talk about the two categorical variables. for example - yes or no, in this case hired or not hired in the recruitment process, or the person having a disease or not.
